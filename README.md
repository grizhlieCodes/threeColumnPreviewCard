# threeColumnPreviewCard for Frontend Mentor

## Project Info

This was a very simple project for me. After helping people who are new to
coding and leaving various comments about 'best practices' I thought it best to
just code this up and see how much of my own advice I stick to without thinking
about it before hand.

## Philosophy - Browser does the heavy lifting

The main message I've been trying to share with newer coders is all about
letting the content dictate the sizing. Upon a quick study of the cards you will
notice I don't set the height anywhere. All I use to dictate the sizing is made
up of the content, white-space (gaps, margins, paddings) and width depending
upon the containers. THe fixed values are quite natural (widths). Heights are
allowed to by dynamic. If we added three times the amount of content into the
`<p class="preview-card__info"></p>` the design would still function. 

It is this very lesson that I think is important to understand when it comes to
best practices of sizing, settings widths/heights etc. Really core stuff ðŸ˜€.

## Avoiding Pixel Perfect

Due to my philosphy, mentioned above, I didn't even measure heights in this
project. Instead I trust the content and the white-space and the max-widths to
control the height which is dynamic. In this case I think it's ok to avoid
pixel-perfection. I do think it's probably damn close though as I did measure
the paddings/gaps from the original design.

## CSS Files

I have 3 CSS files serving the following purposes:

- **reset.css:** This resets our CSS to allow us a clean project. I always reset
  my CSS and dicate all styling from scratch. It's a preference and leads to
  more consistant results I think.

- **helpers.css:** This simply allows me to set the unique background/text
  colors of the 3 cards. I used a different file as it's a habit I picked up in
  CSS. I spread my CSS very logically (I hope) across different files to make
  scalability easier and accessing the CSS i need to find faster.

- **style.css:** This of course is the main style file. Here I imported my
  fonts, set my variables and styled the cards. 


## Some CSS/flexbox knowledge for people I send here

- In `:root` you will find that I set `font-size: 62.5%;`. This is because for
  ease-of-use and responsiveness I use REM units instead of pixels for just
  about everything. But 1 rem by default is equal to about 16 pixels. I simplify
  this further to avoid math and set font-size to 62.5%. Now 1rem = 10pixels,
  2rem = 10pixels and so on. Read more about using EM/REM units, i recommend
  this, rather old, [article](https://j.eremy.net/confused-about-rem-and-em/) or [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI) on
  YouTube as potential resources on the topic. 

- I used `gap: 2.5rem` to space my content within the `preview-card`. I looked
  at the design and noticed that the smallest spacing-unit between 2 elements
  was 2.5rem so that's what I went with by default. However, the svg-icon had
  unique spacing so I added another 1rem to that. For the desktop breakpoint I
  had to add 5.8rem of margin-bottom to the `preview-card__info` paragraph
  element also. You might be asking why I didn't just set an individual
  margin-bottom per element. Simple anwser is that this is habitual. If I had a
  card with 10 elements (for some reason) then I would save time if they all
  shared an 'x' amount of white-space in between them. And then the few unique
  ones would receive their own additional margin-bottoms. 

  - I tried keeping the CSS minimal to avoid any confusion (didn't add anything
    weird I hope)
